Casbah 2.1.5.0 / 2011-05-26 
============================
  * Added support for Scala 2.9.0-1 ... As this is a critical fix release against 2.9.0.final, 2.9.0.final is not supported.  (Note that SBT, etc requires the artifact specified as 2.9.0-1, not 2.9.0.1)
  * Apart from BugFixes this will be the last Casbah release which supports Scala 2.8.0; all future releases will require Scala 2.8.1+ (See [2.8.0 EOL Announcement](http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-casbah-users/browse_thread/thread/faea8dbd5f90aa25)) 
  * [2.9.0 only] Adjusted dynamic settings to build against 2.9.0-1 and Casbah 2.1.5.0
  * [2.9.0 only] Prototype "Dynamic" module (You must enable Scala's support for Dynamic)
  * [2.9.0 only] I seem to have missed project files for SBT and casbah-dynamic
  * [2.9.0 only] Tweaks and adjustments to get this building and testing solidly on 2.9.0-1
  * Disabled a few tests that weren't passing and known to be 'buggy' in specs1.  These are fixed for the upcoming 2.2. release on specs2; they are test bugs rather than Casbah bugs.
  * RegEx $not was just flat out wrong - was producing {"foo": {"foo": /<regex>/}} instead of {"foo": {"$not": {/<regex>/}}
  * Added a getAsOrElse method

==================

  * Migrated MongoCursorBase[T] chained methods to use this.type which returns their proper SUBTYPE instead of undifferentiated superclass MongoCursorBase[T]
  * Moved copy() method to properly return the given subtype in MongoCursor/MongoTypedCursor
  * Replaced explicit asInstanceOf[DBObject] casts of view findOne values to compiler-checked ': DBObject' type annotation

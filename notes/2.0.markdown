Casbah 2\.0 / 2011-01-03 
=========================

Notable Changes since Casbah 1.0.8.1:

* Ownership Change: Casbah is now an officially supported MongoDB Driver 
    * All bugs should be reported at http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SCALA
    * Package Change: Casbah is now `com.mongodb.casbah` (See migration guide)
    * Documentation (ScalaDocs, Migration Guide & Tutorial) is available at http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah
    
* Casbah is now broken into several submodules - see http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah/migrating.html
* Casbah releases are now published to http://scala-tools.org
* SBT Build now publishes -sources and -javadoc artifacts
* Added heavy test coverage
* ++ additivity operator on MongoDBObject for lists of tuple pairs
* Updates to Java Driver wrappings
    * Casbah now wraps Java Driver 2.4 and fully supports all options & interfaces including Replica Set and Write Concern support
    * added a WriteConcern helper object for Scala users w/ named & default args
    * added findAndModify / findAndRemove
    
    
* Stripped out support for implicit Product/Tuple conversions as they're buggy and constantly interfere with other code.
* Migrated Conversions code from core to commons, repackaging as com.mongodb.casbah.commons.conversions
    * Moved loading of ConversionHelpers from Connection creation to instantiation of Commons' Implicits (This means conversions are ALWAYS loaded now for everyone)
    
* Switched off of configgy to slf4j as akka did
    * Added SLF4J-JCL Bindings as a +test* dependency (so we can print logging while testing without forcing you to use an slf4j implementation yourself)

    * Moved Logger from core to commons
    
* Massive improvements to Query DSL:
    * Added new implementations of $in, $nin, $all and $mod with tests. $mod now accepts non-Int numerics and aof two differing types.
    * Full test coverage on DSL (and heavy coverage on other modules)
    * Migrated $each to a now functioning internal hook on $addToSet only exposed in certain circumstances
    * Various cleanups to Type constraints in Query DSL
    * Full support for all documented MongoDB query operators
    * Added new $not syntax, along with identical support for nested queries in $pull
    * Valid Date and Numeric Type boundaries introduced and used instead of Numeric (since Char doesn't actually workwith Mongo and you can't double up type bounds)
    * Added full support for geospatial query.
    * Resolved an issue where the $or wasn't being broken into individual documents as expected. 
    * DSL Operators now return DBObjects rather than Product/Tuple (massive fixes to compatibility and performance result)
    * Added @see linkage to each core operator's doc page
    
* GridFS Changes:
    * GridFS' `files' now returned a MongoCursor not a raw Java DBCursor
    * GridFS findOne now returns an Option[_] and detects nulls like Collection
* Added "safely" resource loaning methods on Collection & DB     
    * Given an operation, uses write concern / durability on a single connection and throws an exception if anything goes wrong.
    
* Culled casbah-mapper.  Mapper now lives as an independent project at http://github.com/maxaf/casbah-mapper
* Bumped version of scala-time to the 0.2 release
* Added DBList support via MongoDBList, following 2.8 collections

* Adjusted boundaries on getAs and expand; the view-permitting Any was causing ambiguity issues at runtime with non AnyRefs (e.g. AnyVal). 
* Fixed an assumption in expand which could cause runtime failure 
  * Updated MongoDBObject factory & builder to explicitly return a type; some pieces were assuming at runtime that it was a MongoDBObjectBuilder$anon1 which was FUBAR

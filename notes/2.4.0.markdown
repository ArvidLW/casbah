==================

  * Hide BasicDBList; now, getAs and As and related will always return a MongoDBList which is a Seq[_].  Enjoy!
    + This is an API breakage - you should *never* get back a BasicDBList from Casbah anymore, and asking for 
      one will cause a ClassCastException.  This brings us more in line with sane Scala APIs

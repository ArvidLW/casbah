[Casbah](http://github.com/mongodb/casbah "Casbah") is the official Scala driver for MongoDB.  It provides Scala wrappers to the Java driver, a DSL query syntax and full Scala type support (MongoDB will never give you a Java type from Casbah unless you asked it to).  A [tutorial and setup instructions](http://api.mongodb.org/scala/casbah/) are available.

[Casbah](http://github.com/mongodb/casbah "Casbah") wraps the official MongoDB Java Driver and provides the functionality and tools that Scala developers expect without reinventing the wheel uneccessarily. The current (latest) version has been tested against MongoDB 2.0.x with Java driver 2.8.0-RC1

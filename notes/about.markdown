Formerly known as "mongo-scala-wrappers", [Casbah](http://github.com/novus/casbah "Casbah") provides a series of wrappers and DSL-like  (AKA fluid query syntax) functionality for better utilizing MongoDB from within Scala. This wraps the official MongoDB Java Driver, attempting to provide more Scala-like functionality on top of it. The current (latest) version has been tested against MongoDB 1.4.x, with the 2.0 Java Driver (not all 2.0 driver features are wired in yet, as development began against 1.x). Your Mileage May Vary. See the docs and test classes for information on best practices and functionality.

There is a potentially useful [Casbah Tutorial](http://novus.github.com/docs/casbah/sphinx/html/intro/getting_started.html) which gives you everything you need to know to be dangerous.

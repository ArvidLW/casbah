Casbah is an interface for [MongoDB][MongoDB] to be provide more flexible access from both Java and Scala.  Most specifically focused on providing a Scala oriented wrapper interface around the Java mongo driver.

For the Scala side, contains series of wrappers and DSL-like functionality for utilizing MongoDB from within Scala. This currently utilises the very Java-oriented Mongo Java driver, and attempts to provide more scala-like functionality on top of it. This has been tested with MongoDB 1.2.x+ and v2.x of the Mongo java driver.

We are constantly adding new functionality, and maintain a detailed [Tutorial][Tutorial].

### Brendan W. McAdams <bmcadams@novus.com>

Interfaces for [MongoDB][MongoDB]  to be more flexibly accessible from both Java and Scala.  Most specifically focused on providing a Scala oriented wrapper interface around the Java mongo driver.

For the Scala side, contains series of wrappers and DSL-like functionality for utilizing MongoDB from within Scala. This currently utilises the very Java-oriented Mongo Java driver, and attempts to provide more scala-like functionality on top of it. This has been tested with MongoDB 1.2.x+ and v1.x of the Mongo java driver (Not 2.0 Java driver yet). 

This code is available at both [GitHub][GitHub] and [BitBucket][BitBucket].  BitBucket is the primary repository, with clones pushed to GitHub on a regular basis.

The latest API Documentation is available [here][here].
